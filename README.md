# Dev4Geo

Dev4Geo is a collaborative platform where geologists and other users can request new programs or websites that benefit the geological community. This repository is open for contributions from developers who want to help build tools that make a difference in the field of geology.

## Project Description

Dev4Geo aims to connect geologists with developers to create useful tools, software, and websites tailored to the needs of the geological community.
